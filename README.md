# Basic-sentiment-analysis

Welcome to my sentiment analysis project! In this project, I used the power of R programming to analyze and understand the sentiment of text data. Whether it's analyzing customer reviews, social media posts, or even movie reviews, sentiment analysis is a powerful tool for gaining insights from text data.

The project consists of two main parts: data preparation and sentiment analysis.

For data preparation, I used various R packages to clean and preprocess the text data. This included removing unnecessary characters and stopwords.

For sentiment analysis, I used the NRC sentiments scores from the syuzhet package to classify the sentiment of each text into positive, negative, or various other emotional states. I also visualized the results using the ggplot2 package to get a better understanding of the overall sentiment of the data.

Through this project, I gained valuable skills in data preparation and sentiment analysis using R. I hope that you find this project useful and informative, and that it inspires you to explore the power of R for text analysis. Thank you for checking out my project!
